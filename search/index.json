[{"content":"I always have to do something to keep my mind clear, to activate my thoughts, and to consciously train myself to think from different perspectives. As my cold gradually gets better, I feel it\u0026rsquo;s time to write something.\nGood Thoughts On April 3rd, 2025, I arrived at Qiongshan Cemetery and Lingshan Memorial Park. There, I took some photos that I felt were worth recording, to preserve them as memories for later.\nSky, Trees, and Tombstones The air was crisp, the sun filtered through branches, and fresh flowers laid in front of graves spoke of love that remains. Some tombs were meticulously cleaned, others overgrown and nearly forgotten. In that quiet contrast, I felt the weight of remembrance ‚Äî not just for individuals, but for what we choose to preserve or let fade.\nDepiction One image struck me deeply: an elderly man crouching before a tombstone, carefully repainting the faded red characters. A tin of paint, a brush, and unwavering focus ‚Äî this was devotion in its simplest form.\nNameless Souls As I wandered further, I saw gravestones cracked, leaning, and some buried in weeds. Nature reclaims even memory, if we allow it. And yet, even in neglect, there was a kind of beauty ‚Äî the wildflowers, the rustling wind, the cycles of time.\nFuture Resting PlaceÂÆø At the back, a sign marked ‚ÄúZone 17, 20‚Äù ‚Äî perhaps a quiet reminder that even order exists in death. Paths diverged into thick grass and whispering trees. I walked slowly, thinking not just about my family, but about all the unnamed souls beneath my feet.\nDiscarded Waste Behind a tree, I found a pile of discarded plastic. It was jarring ‚Äî grief, respect, waste, all jumbled in one frame. What should be sacred sometimes becomes cluttered by habit. What is forgotten becomes part of the land.\nQingming is more than a ritual. It is an invitation to reflect ‚Äî not just on the dead, but on how we live. It asks: Who do we remember? What do we pass down? And what does it mean to truly honor the past?\n‚ÄúIn the gentle brightness of Qingming, we meet both memory and renewal.‚Äù\nüì∏ All photos taken by me during this year\u0026rsquo;s Qingming visit.\n","date":"2025-04-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://liangzhong2077.github.io/p/scenes-from-a-qingming-day/qm_hu_ee512b036993bb75.png","permalink":"https://liangzhong2077.github.io/p/scenes-from-a-qingming-day/","title":"Scenes from a Qingming Day"},{"content":"üìòNotes on A Guide to Econometrics Research at Princeton (by Michael S. Weisbach) ‚ú® Preface PhD students should devote their time to the following activities:\nInitiating research projects Convincing readers to care about their papers Writing papers Presenting research Accumulating the human capital necessary for a successful academic career after completing the dissertation ‚ÄúToo many papers are astonishingly long and mind-numbingly dull; introductions ramble on without clarifying the core argument; data descriptions lack detail, making replication impossible; tables are unnecessary or confusingly labeled; the writing is dry and passive. Presentations reveal main results only in the final five minutes; slides are poorly designed and unreadable; junior scholars lack coherent research agendas and don‚Äôt engage with academic communities.‚Äù\nThe author emphasizes:\nResearchers should treat each paper as part of a broader research agenda‚Äîaimed at building a coherent program of inquiry, not just producing standalone contributions.\nüß† Core insight: The earlier a scholar realizes that interesting writing is crucial to writing well, the better their work will be.\nüß™ Chapter 1: How to Conduct Academic Research Three Key Characteristics of Research (as illustrated by Andrew Wiles): Pose your own questions:\nMuch of research involves crafting the right questions, not just answering existing ones.\nCollaborate and seek feedback:\nMost papers are coauthored. Even solo work benefits from frequent discussion and revision.\nClarify your contribution and motivation:\nA good paper explains not only what it does but also why it matters.\nThe \u0026ldquo;hidden curriculum\u0026rdquo; of PhD training: Beyond coursework, PhD students learn what makes research important by participating in discussions (e.g., at NBER), dissecting models, evaluating empirical work, and identifying unanswered questions.\nCurrent Trends: Academic research is increasingly global. Fields are becoming more specialized and narrow. Publishing in top journals is increasingly competitive. Academic circles are more political and closed. üß† Advice:\nAvoid becoming a ‚Äúmulti-project procrastinator‚Äù or a ‚Äúperfectionist with no output.‚Äù Learn to create a research map‚Äîwhat do we know, what don‚Äôt we know, and why aren‚Äôt certain problems solved? Writing isn‚Äôt just about publication‚Äîit‚Äôs about engaging others, informing, and stimulating thought.\nüéØ Chapter 2: Choosing Research Topics A Two-Step Framework: Clarify your long-term goals. Choose specific projects that align with your broader agenda. The Power of Focus: Working on a related set of questions creates research continuity. Enhances academic identity and helps in obtaining letters of recommendation. For example: ‚ÄúThe effects of machine learning on advertising‚Äù ‚ÄúCauses and consequences of Euro adoption in Europe‚Äù Research Motivation: Be a research hunter, solving problems that genuinely interest you‚Äînot just chasing hot topics or grant money.\nExample: Kahneman and Tversky challenged the rational behavior paradigm through disagreement and independent thought, focusing on underexplored but important ideas.\nMethodological Style: Alan Krueger exemplified this through labor economics using empirically identifiable methods. Emphasized originality, hand-collected data, and causal inference. Self-Assessment Checklist: Am I excited about this topic? Will I still enjoy working on it repeatedly? Is it worth investing time to learn new tools/background? Can I leverage my comparative advantages? Starting Points for Research: Revisit classical problems with new perspectives. Address large real-world issues that remain poorly understood. Avoid overcrowded topics‚Äîaim for fundamental, underexplored, structurally important questions. The most influential research often arises from genuinely important problems.\nüé≤ Chapter 3: Strategic Issues in Building a Research Portfolio Research Goal: Produce impactful work that reshapes how people think about important questions‚Äînot just pad your CV with unread papers.\nExplanation beats quantity and publication venue:\nYour impact depends on how well you clarify what new knowledge your paper contributes.\nIdeal situation:\nAlways have several projects in a presentable stage.\nCoauthorship Strategy: Seek collaborators with complementary interests and skills. Prioritize those who can get things done. Understand the dynamics: senior vs junior scholars, reputational risks, and motivational alignment. üß† Coauthor Checklist:\nIs their research aligned with yours? Can they bring skills or networks you lack? What happens if disagreements arise? How much effort will each party contribute? üìù Chapter 4: Strategies for Drafting a Paper Challenge for unknown authors:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s harder to get into top journals or course syllabi without name recognition.\nReviewers care most about:\nAbstract Introduction (Main body is secondary; appendices are rarely read) Therefore: Your writing strategy should focus on crafting concise and compelling abstracts and introductions.\n","date":"2025-03-29T00:00:00Z","image":"https://liangzhong2077.github.io/images/resized_image.jpg","permalink":"https://liangzhong2077.github.io/p/notes-on-a-guide-to-econometrics-research-at-princeton/","title":"Notes on *A Guide to Econometrics Research at Princeton*"},{"content":"This is my first digital footprint on the web‚Äîthink of it as me awkwardly waving hello from the edge of cyberspace. Stay tuned as I figure out what I\u0026rsquo;m doing here (and pretend I‚Äôve always known).\nWhy I Started This Blog \u0026ldquo;Tick,tock,make me creep Never ending counting sheep Never get no sleep\u0026rdquo;\nIn short, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been sleeping well lately. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;He who has no long-term worries must have immediate concerns.\u0026rdquo; Looking back now, I realize I‚Äôve been worrying about the fact that I have neither‚Äîno urgent matters, no grand plans. When a person is well-fed and idle, they tend to look for something to do. So, what to do? Well, why not build a website‚Äîa small corner of the web to jot things down as they come?\nWhere do I stand, and what lies ahead? I\u0026rsquo;m sitting in the library of Fenglin Campus at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, surrounded by rows upon rows of tidy, orderly desks. Strangely, I don‚Äôt find it comforting‚Äîit reminds me too much of my high school days. So many people, each with different faces and forms\u0026hellip; yet how different are they, really? What I‚Äôm doing now, and what I aim to do in the future, is quite simple: to make myself stand apart from the crowd.\nWell, That‚Äôs Enough for Today Maybe this post won‚Äôt mean much in the long run. But for now, it\u0026rsquo;s a small step toward clarity, toward something that feels like purpose.
