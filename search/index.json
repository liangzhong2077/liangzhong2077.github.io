[{"content":"üìòNotes on A Guide to Econometrics Research at Princeton (by Michael S. Weisbach) ‚ú® Preface PhD students should devote their time to the following activities:\nInitiating research projects Convincing readers to care about their papers Writing papers Presenting research Accumulating the human capital necessary for a successful academic career after completing the dissertation ‚ÄúToo many papers are astonishingly long and mind-numbingly dull; introductions ramble on without clarifying the core argument; data descriptions lack detail, making replication impossible; tables are unnecessary or confusingly labeled; the writing is dry and passive. Presentations reveal main results only in the final five minutes; slides are poorly designed and unreadable; junior scholars lack coherent research agendas and don‚Äôt engage with academic communities.‚Äù\nThe author emphasizes:\nResearchers should treat each paper as part of a broader research agenda‚Äîaimed at building a coherent program of inquiry, not just producing standalone contributions.\nüß† Core insight: The earlier a scholar realizes that interesting writing is crucial to writing well, the better their work will be.\nüß™ Chapter 1: How to Conduct Academic Research Three Key Characteristics of Research (as illustrated by Andrew Wiles): Pose your own questions:\nMuch of research involves crafting the right questions, not just answering existing ones.\nCollaborate and seek feedback:\nMost papers are coauthored. Even solo work benefits from frequent discussion and revision.\nClarify your contribution and motivation:\nA good paper explains not only what it does but also why it matters.\nThe \u0026ldquo;hidden curriculum\u0026rdquo; of PhD training: Beyond coursework, PhD students learn what makes research important by participating in discussions (e.g., at NBER), dissecting models, evaluating empirical work, and identifying unanswered questions.\nCurrent Trends: Academic research is increasingly global. Fields are becoming more specialized and narrow. Publishing in top journals is increasingly competitive. Academic circles are more political and closed. üß† Advice:\nAvoid becoming a ‚Äúmulti-project procrastinator‚Äù or a ‚Äúperfectionist with no output.‚Äù Learn to create a research map‚Äîwhat do we know, what don‚Äôt we know, and why aren‚Äôt certain problems solved? Writing isn‚Äôt just about publication‚Äîit‚Äôs about engaging others, informing, and stimulating thought.\nüéØ Chapter 2: Choosing Research Topics A Two-Step Framework: Clarify your long-term goals. Choose specific projects that align with your broader agenda. The Power of Focus: Working on a related set of questions creates research continuity. Enhances academic identity and helps in obtaining letters of recommendation. For example: ‚ÄúThe effects of machine learning on advertising‚Äù ‚ÄúCauses and consequences of Euro adoption in Europe‚Äù Research Motivation: Be a research hunter, solving problems that genuinely interest you‚Äînot just chasing hot topics or grant money.\nExample: Kahneman and Tversky challenged the rational behavior paradigm through disagreement and independent thought, focusing on underexplored but important ideas.\nMethodological Style: Alan Krueger exemplified this through labor economics using empirically identifiable methods. Emphasized originality, hand-collected data, and causal inference. Self-Assessment Checklist: Am I excited about this topic? Will I still enjoy working on it repeatedly? Is it worth investing time to learn new tools/background? Can I leverage my comparative advantages? Starting Points for Research: Revisit classical problems with new perspectives. Address large real-world issues that remain poorly understood. Avoid overcrowded topics‚Äîaim for fundamental, underexplored, structurally important questions. The most influential research often arises from genuinely important problems.\nüé≤ Chapter 3: Strategic Issues in Building a Research Portfolio Research Goal: Produce impactful work that reshapes how people think about important questions‚Äînot just pad your CV with unread papers.\nExplanation beats quantity and publication venue:\nYour impact depends on how well you clarify what new knowledge your paper contributes.\nIdeal situation:\nAlways have several projects in a presentable stage.\nCoauthorship Strategy: Seek collaborators with complementary interests and skills. Prioritize those who can get things done. Understand the dynamics: senior vs junior scholars, reputational risks, and motivational alignment. üß† Coauthor Checklist:\nIs their research aligned with yours? Can they bring skills or networks you lack? What happens if disagreements arise? How much effort will each party contribute? üìù Chapter 4: Strategies for Drafting a Paper Challenge for unknown authors:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s harder to get into top journals or course syllabi without name recognition.\nReviewers care most about:\nAbstract Introduction (Main body is secondary; appendices are rarely read) Therefore: Your writing strategy should focus on crafting concise and compelling abstracts and introductions.\n","date":"2025-03-29T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://liangzhong2077.github.io/p/notes-on-a-guide-to-econometrics-research-at-princeton/","title":"Notes on *A Guide to Econometrics Research at Princeton*"},{"content":"This is my first digital footprint on the web‚Äîthink of it as me awkwardly waving hello from the edge of cyberspace. Stay tuned as I figure out what I\u0026rsquo;m doing here (and pretend I‚Äôve always known).\nWhy I Started This Blog \u0026ldquo;Tick,tock,make me creep Never ending counting sheep Never get no sleep\u0026rdquo;\nIn short, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been sleeping well lately. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;He who has no long-term worries must have immediate concerns.\u0026rdquo; Looking back now, I realize I‚Äôve been worrying about the fact that I have neither‚Äîno urgent matters, no grand plans. When a person is well-fed and idle, they tend to look for something to do. So, what to do? Well, why not build a website‚Äîa small corner of the web to jot things down as they come?\nWhere do I stand, and what lies ahead? I\u0026rsquo;m sitting in the library of Fenglin Campus at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, surrounded by rows upon rows of tidy, orderly desks. Strangely, I don‚Äôt find it comforting‚Äîit reminds me too much of my high school days. So many people, each with different faces and forms\u0026hellip; yet how different are they, really? What I‚Äôm doing now, and what I aim to do in the future, is quite simple: to make myself stand apart from the crowd.\nWell, That‚Äôs Enough for Today Maybe this post won‚Äôt mean much in the long run. But for now, it\u0026rsquo;s a small step toward clarity, toward something that feels like purpose. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s enough for today.\n","date":"2025-03-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://liangzhong2077.github.io/p/beginnings-and-beyond/pawel-czerwinski-8uZPynIu-rQ-unsplash_hu_e95a4276bf860a84.jpg","permalink":"https://liangzhong2077.github.io/p/beginnings-and-beyond/","title":"Beginnings and Beyond"},{"content":"Lorem est tota propiore conpellat pectoribus de pectora summo.\nRedit teque digerit hominumque toris verebor lumina non cervice subde tollit usus habet Arctonque, furores quas nec ferunt.
