        <description>&lt;img src="https://liangzhong2077.github.io/p/beginnings-and-beyond/pawel-czerwinski-8uZPynIu-rQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Beginnings and Beyond" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my first digital footprint on the web—think of it as me awkwardly waving hello from the edge of cyberspace. Stay tuned as I figure out what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here (and pretend I’ve always known).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-started-this-blog&#34;&gt;Why I Started This Blog
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tick,tock,make me creep
Never ending counting sheep
Never get no sleep&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been sleeping well lately.
As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;He who has no long-term worries must have immediate concerns.&amp;rdquo;
Looking back now, I realize I’ve been worrying about the fact that I have neither—no urgent matters, no grand plans.
When a person is well-fed and idle, they tend to look for something to do.
So, what to do?
Well, why not build a website—a small corner of the web to jot things down as they come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-do-i-stand-and-what-lies-ahead&#34;&gt;Where do I stand, and what lies ahead?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the library of Fenglin Campus at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, surrounded by rows upon rows of tidy, orderly desks.
Strangely, I don’t find it comforting—it reminds me too much of my high school days.
So many people, each with different faces and forms&amp;hellip; yet how different are they, really?
What I’m doing now, and what I aim to do in the future, is quite simple:
to make myself stand apart from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;well-thats-enough-for-today&#34;&gt;Well, That’s Enough for Today
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this post won’t mean much in the long run. But for now, it&amp;rsquo;s a small step toward clarity, toward something that feels like purpose.
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s enough for today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
