        <description>&lt;img src="https://liangzhong2077.github.io/p/scenes-from-a-qingming-day/qm.png" alt="Featured image of post Scenes from a Qingming Day" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always have to do something to keep my mind clear, to activate my thoughts, and to consciously train myself to think from different perspectives. As my cold gradually gets better, I feel it&amp;rsquo;s time to write something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-thoughts&#34;&gt;Good Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 3rd, 2025, I arrived at Qiongshan Cemetery and Lingshan Memorial Park. There, I took some photos that I felt were worth recording, to preserve them as memories for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sky-trees-and-tombstones&#34;&gt;Sky, Trees, and Tombstones
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;qm2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tombstones among trees&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 700px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The air was crisp, the sun filtered through branches, and fresh flowers laid in front of graves spoke of love that remains. Some tombs were meticulously cleaned, others overgrown and nearly forgotten. In that quiet contrast, I felt the weight of remembrance ‚Äî not just for individuals, but for what we choose to preserve or let fade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;depiction&#34;&gt;Depiction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;qm3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Elder repainting tombstone&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 700px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One image struck me deeply: an elderly man crouching before a tombstone, carefully repainting the faded red characters. A tin of paint, a brush, and unwavering focus ‚Äî this was devotion in its simplest form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nameless-souls&#34;&gt;Nameless Souls
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;qm4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Neglected graves&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 700px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wandered further, I saw gravestones cracked, leaning, and some buried in weeds. Nature reclaims even memory, if we allow it. And yet, even in neglect, there was a kind of beauty ‚Äî the wildflowers, the rustling wind, the cycles of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-resting-placeÂÆø&#34;&gt;Future Resting PlaceÂÆø
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;qm6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Signpost in cemetery&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 700px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the back, a sign marked ‚ÄúZone 17, 20‚Äù ‚Äî perhaps a quiet reminder that even order exists in death. Paths diverged into thick grass and whispering trees. I walked slowly, thinking not just about my family, but about all the unnamed souls beneath my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discarded-waste&#34;&gt;Discarded Waste
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;qm8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Discarded materials&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 700px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem auto; display: block;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind a tree, I found a pile of discarded plastic. It was jarring ‚Äî grief, respect, waste, all jumbled in one frame. What should be sacred sometimes becomes cluttered by habit. What is forgotten becomes part of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qingming is more than a ritual. It is an invitation to reflect ‚Äî not just on the dead, but on how we live. It asks: Who do we remember? What do we pass down? And what does it mean to truly honor the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn the gentle brightness of Qingming, we meet both memory and renewal.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üì∏ &lt;em&gt;All photos taken by me during this year&amp;rsquo;s Qingming visit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
